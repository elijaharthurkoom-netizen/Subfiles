[reporter 1] This noodle shop
has been here for 50 years.

01:53.029 --> 01:55.073
Amid puddles from last night's rain,

01:55.156 --> 01:58.493
police have cordoned off
the scene of a shocking crime.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.912
The shop's owner
was found on the premises,

02:00.995 --> 02:03.248
the victim of a gruesome murder.

02:03.331 --> 02:07.669
Initial leads suggest the motive
may be linked to financial disputes.

02:07.752 --> 02:10.588
The victim, Mr. Lin,
whose parents are deceased,

02:10.672 --> 02:12.215

of former speaker Ouyang Hsiang.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.573
The police have identified a suspect.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.201
Seven years ago, the suspect
had an altercation with the victim,

02:40.285 --> 02:42.537
during which Ouyang Ti was stabbed.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.205

After months of public unease, the police
have captured The Rainstorm Killer.

Let's go and ask.

-[woman 3] Hi.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.589

-Yeah.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.801
I just moved in last week.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.845
Sorry I didn't introduce myself.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.430
[woman 1] Oh, that's okay.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.224
Are you renting, or did you buy?

07:13.307 --> 07:14.725
Uh, why?

07:14.809 --> 07:16.519
Uh, since moving in,

07:16.602 --> 07:21.149
have you heard the sound of high heels
clacking back and forth at night,

07:21.232 --> 07:24.610
or has your doorbell been ringing nonstop?

07:25.611 --> 07:26.446
No. Why?

07:26.529 --> 07:27.822
[woman 1] Before you moved in,

07:27.905 --> 07:30.575
you should have come
and spoken to the neighbors

07:30.658 --> 07:32.034
to see if it was haunted.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.786
Then you wouldn't have got duped.

A beautiful young woman
used to live in that apartment,

07:44.338 --> 07:46.966
but she was murdered in the mountains.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.260
You're saying she was murdered?

07:49.343 --> 07:50.219
[woman 2] Mm.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.014
But not in the apartment.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.183
It can't be haunted then.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.935

as long as there are ghosts.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.193

Tell me.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.280

08:52.323 --> 08:57.745
It's just Ta-wei asked me
to follow up on his cases.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.165
you can't steal me.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.836

Didn't he refuse before?

09:15.513 --> 09:18.057
Mm. Ta-wei wouldn't accept it.

09:18.140 --> 09:21.227
So he asked me to write to Jen-yao.

09:21.310 --> 09:25.439
He told me, "Try to use phrases
that make you sound feminine."

09:25.523 --> 09:28.109
Well, here's hoping that works.

09:28.192 --> 09:31.487

that he's agreed to meet me.

but you have to follow procedure.

You can't just--

10:03.769 --> 10:06.897
[Ta-wei] If you don't tell
and I don't tell, who's gonna know, right?

10:06.981 --> 10:10.067
Hsu Ta-wei, are you tired of this life?

10:10.568 --> 10:12.194
Do you have a death wish?

10:12.695 --> 10:16.157
Okay, I'll grant you your wish.
I'll be your assistant today.

Don't be nervous. I don't bite.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.344
I don't usually get nervous.

14:05.845 --> 14:09.265
For some reason,
it feels strange meeting you.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.142
You seem oddly familiar.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.104
But we've never met before.

14:15.187 --> 14:18.107
Uh, what am I doing? [exhales]

14:18.899 --> 14:20.025
The point is,

14:20.109 --> 14:21.277
when I wrote to you,

14:21.360 --> 14:25.781
I told you our company
wants to make a documentary on you.

14:26.782 --> 14:30.119
About the crimes that you committed.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.371
Why choose me?

14:34.832 --> 14:35.833
Uh…

14:37.293 --> 14:40.629
You'll have to ask
our director, Hsu Ta-wei.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.507
I don't know the reason.

14:44.091 --> 14:49.471
But probably because
there's a lot about your case

14:49.555 --> 14:52.516
the audience would be curious about.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.936
Anyway, we hope you'll agree to the shoot.

15:01.692 --> 15:04.278
Is it important to you, this job?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.743
[exhales] Mm.

15:14.830 --> 15:15.789
All right.

15:17.708 --> 15:18.542
Count me in.

You're in?

15:22.379 --> 15:24.632
-Mm-hmm.
-[Chou-yu] You'll really do it?

15:27.259 --> 15:30.387
But if I don't like the questions,

15:30.888 --> 15:31.931
I won't answer.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.767
All right. We can respect that.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.773
I'll take you through what happens next.

15:40.856 --> 15:41.899
Mm.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.527
Essentially, there are three stages.

15:46.195 --> 15:49.698
Preproduction, production,
post-production.

15:50.199 --> 15:53.285
But you are only involved
for the production period.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.371
That's when filming takes place.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.331
You'll do your own introduction,

15:57.414 --> 16:00.209
then we'll ask you a number of questions.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.879
When the time comes, we'll go over the…

16:12.513 --> 16:14.390
We're almost out of time.

16:15.599 --> 16:16.642
That's all for today.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.514
You said no to everyone else.

16:55.597 --> 16:56.557
[phone beeps]

16:56.640 --> 16:58.392
[exhales] It cut off.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.436
Did you hear me?

17:14.033 --> 17:16.452
[gentle music playing]

17:33.886 --> 17:35.054
[music fades]

17:35.137 --> 17:39.808
Maybe it's because it's my first time
seeing a death row inmate…

17:41.894 --> 17:43.771
but I have this feeling

17:44.438 --> 17:46.315
I don't know how to describe.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.776
A death row inmate? Who's that?

17:49.276 --> 17:51.236
Have you heard of Li Jen-yao?

17:51.737 --> 17:54.531
He's a serial killer.
He killed his own dad.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.617
Do you remember that?

17:57.826 --> 17:59.536
[mysterious music playing]

17:59.620 --> 18:00.954
Yeah, of course.

18:01.830 --> 18:05.000
Those murders were all over the news.
I remember.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.965
Even inside a prison,
he's still dangerous.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.676
You should probably stay away from him.

18:15.594 --> 18:19.807
Before I actually met him,
I thought he would be terrifying.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.477
But,

18:25.020 --> 18:26.688
after meeting him today,

18:27.356 --> 18:29.608
he really doesn't seem

18:30.609 --> 18:32.569
as bad as the media says.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.953
Seeing him up close,

18:41.787 --> 18:44.039
he doesn't look like a murderer.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.457
[music fades]

18:48.043 --> 18:48.919
Hey.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.923
-Do you think he's hot?
-Of course not!

18:53.549 --> 18:55.217
Then why are you defending him?

18:56.009 --> 18:58.220
-[Chou-yu] Don't pull that crap.
-All right.

19:00.764 --> 19:01.807
You done moving?

19:02.516 --> 19:03.851
Need help with anything?

19:05.435 --> 19:09.815
I said I'd help you find a place,
but you did it alone.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.526
And look what you got.
A haunted apartment.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.029
Don't be like that.

19:16.113 --> 19:19.825
I've told you many times.
I can take care of myself.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.161
You're not my mother.

19:22.661 --> 19:23.537
Hmm.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.456
Even your mom's not this bossy.

19:27.124 --> 19:30.460
Anyway, the apartment was just bad luck.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.588
-[scoffs] Bad luck?
-Mm.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.381
You jumped at the price.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.425
Rent for under 10K?

19:36.925 --> 19:38.760
Didn't you think that was weird?

19:39.261 --> 19:41.889
I didn't think about it that much.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.768
From what the neighbors said,

19:47.269 --> 19:49.855
she didn't die there, so it isn't haunted.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.648
What are you afraid of?

19:53.233 --> 19:55.903
-What if she's homesick?
-Huh?

19:56.403 --> 19:58.655
What if she wants to come back?

19:58.739 --> 20:01.325
What if she suddenly appears?

20:03.118 --> 20:06.747
I saved some fruit for you!
Take it to school. Don't forget it.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.957
-Here, take it--
-Uh, no, thank you. Uh…

20:09.041 --> 20:10.834
Sorry. Sorry.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.795
[Chou-yu] Is that your fruit stall?

20:13.879 --> 20:16.131
[somber music playing]

20:16.215 --> 20:19.134
Uh, that's right. We set up here recently.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.511
Come see us if you want some fruit.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.765
[woman] Here, it's very sweet.
I picked it myself.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.100
-Go on, take it.
-All right, all right, that's enough.

20:28.101 --> 20:30.854
Sorry. My wife just seems to like you.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.690
She's harmless. Apologies.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.567
All right, let's go.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.110
Hey, don't be late for school.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.490
[music fades]

20:44.243 --> 20:45.702
-Come on.
-Hey.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.372
Shen, do you remember them?

20:48.455 --> 20:51.667
I've seen them before.
Their stall was outside your apartment.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.252
It's like…

20:54.503 --> 20:56.964
It's like they found out where I live.

20:58.590 --> 21:02.803
And that lady seems to think
I'm someone else.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.221
It's weird.

21:04.846 --> 21:07.349
Hey. You're so paranoid.

21:07.432 --> 21:10.686
Taipei fruit sellers
always move their stalls around.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.854
It's just a coincidence.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.065
-Mm.
-Come on.

21:34.334 --> 21:37.462
Hey, how did you find this apartment?

21:37.546 --> 21:39.840
[sighs] I told you already.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.092
I found this place online.

21:42.592 --> 21:46.096
[man] Ms. Chou,
a delivery came for you earlier.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.723
I didn't order anything.

21:55.814 --> 21:56.648
[chuckles]

21:57.983 --> 21:59.359
Who is it from?

22:00.110 --> 22:01.528
Chi-chi sent it.

22:01.611 --> 22:04.156
It's a housewarming gift. [chuckles]

22:08.493 --> 22:09.494
[door opens]

22:13.123 --> 22:13.999
[door closes]

22:18.795 --> 22:19.629
[gasps]

22:20.339 --> 22:21.673
Don't freak me out.

22:22.257 --> 22:23.425
What did you see?

22:25.093 --> 22:26.887
There really is a ghost.

22:27.429 --> 22:30.307
A ghost would never live in this mess.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.852
Hey, how long have you been here?

22:34.561 --> 22:36.146
Why haven't you unpacked?

22:36.646 --> 22:39.358
And why are these socks here? [groans]

22:41.109 --> 22:44.988
Hey, is that pile of clothes
clean or dirty?

22:45.072 --> 22:46.323
And where do you sleep?

22:47.824 --> 22:50.118
Uh, wherever.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.829
Seriously,

22:53.622 --> 22:56.833
you shouldn't be living alone.
You should move back in with me.

22:59.252 --> 23:02.005
I don't want to talk about it.
Come on, sit down.

23:03.006 --> 23:05.467
Here. I'll give Chi-chi a call.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.643
Hi, Chi-chi! [chuckles]

23:14.726 --> 23:16.269
I received your gift!

23:16.770 --> 23:17.604
Thank you.

23:17.687 --> 23:18.855
[Chi-chi] Hey there.

23:18.939 --> 23:22.275
You haven't invited me over.
How have you been?

23:22.359 --> 23:23.318
[Chou-yu] I'm fine.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.237
Things have been good.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.864
[Chi-chi] Yeah, right.
I can tell something's off.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.450
Hey. I'm your best friend.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.077
Don't keep secrets from me.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.162
We're supposed
to tell each other everything.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.623
Are you gonna tell me or not?

23:37.124 --> 23:39.668
Are you gonna tell me,
or do I need to come over?

23:39.751 --> 23:41.962
It's nothing. Don't worry.

23:42.462 --> 23:43.588
We'll talk more later.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.048
[Chi-chi sighs] Fine.

23:45.132 --> 23:47.008
All right, see you. Bye-bye.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.514
Hey, stop tidying!

23:52.597 --> 23:54.015
I'll do it. Stop it.

23:54.766 --> 23:57.269
You're acting like
I brought you here to clean up.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.438
I feel guilty.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.356
[chuckles] It's no big deal.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.734
I mean, I washed your clothes
when we lived together.

24:04.818 --> 24:07.070
All right, just sit down. Just sit down.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.739
[cell phone buzzes]

24:10.699 --> 24:11.575
Huh?

24:12.451 --> 24:15.787
[cell phone continues buzzing]

24:25.255 --> 24:27.549
How did my phone get in my bag?

24:31.136 --> 24:32.012
Ta-wei.

24:32.888 --> 24:33.722
Oh.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.016
Okay, hold on.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.184
So…

24:37.684 --> 24:38.560
[pen clicks]

24:38.643 --> 24:41.313
Next week, we film Li Jen-yao.

24:41.396 --> 24:44.274
All right. I'll get everything ready
and call you back.

24:44.357 --> 24:46.067
Okay. Bye-bye.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.153
[uneasy music playing]

24:58.413 --> 24:59.289
[music fades]

25:08.465 --> 25:11.218
FIRST MEETING WITH LI JEN-YAO

25:11.301 --> 25:13.178
[gentle music playing]

25:21.061 --> 25:21.895
[music stops]

25:23.063 --> 25:23.897
[gasps]

25:30.278 --> 25:32.280
[rain pouring]

25:39.538 --> 25:40.789
Is that rain?

25:54.386 --> 25:56.680
-[rain stops]
-[static electricity crackles]

26:05.230 --> 26:07.232
["Clair de Lune" playing]

27:35.612 --> 27:37.739
[woman, muffled] Hsiao-tung,
are you there?

27:38.573 --> 27:39.783
Can you hear me?

27:41.368 --> 27:42.869
[unmuffled] Can you hear my voice?

27:44.329 --> 27:47.207
[loudly] Hsiao-tung, you need to wake up.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.291
[music stops]

27:52.170 --> 27:53.254
[Shen] What's wrong?

27:55.382 --> 27:56.716
Did something wake you up?

27:57.801 --> 27:59.135
I'm fine. It's nothing.

27:59.219 --> 28:02.138
[Chou-yu gasping]

28:04.849 --> 28:07.769
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

28:08.269 --> 28:11.064
[panicked breathing]
What the hell was that dream?

28:12.565 --> 28:14.567
[gentle music playing]

28:26.996 --> 28:28.498
-[knocking on door]
-[Shen] Pin-yu?

28:29.708 --> 28:30.583
Are you okay?

28:31.668 --> 28:32.544
[toilet flushes]

28:33.211 --> 28:34.796
Uh, I'm all right!

28:34.879 --> 28:36.423
I'm just on the toilet!

28:49.102 --> 28:50.770
[unsettling music playing]

28:50.854 --> 28:53.231
[ominous music sting plays]

28:55.608 --> 28:57.652
[Chou-yu screams]

28:57.736 --> 28:59.154
-Shen Mu!
-[Shen] What is it?

28:59.237 --> 29:00.947
[panicked breathing]

29:01.030 --> 29:06.411
[Chou-yu] In the mirror just now,
I saw a girl. [gasping]

29:06.494 --> 29:09.080
You're tired. It was just your reflection.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.082
No, it was definitely someone else.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.959
Take a look. I'm scared.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.755
[uneasy music continues]

29:49.037 --> 29:49.871
[music fades]

29:50.455 --> 29:53.374
-Ma'am, please just calm down.
-[woman] What is it you want?

29:53.458 --> 29:54.918
[sighs]

29:55.001 --> 29:56.961
I'm not breaking my lease.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.922
I just want some answers.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.840
What happened in the apartment?

30:01.341 --> 30:03.343
Why is the rent so cheap?

30:03.927 --> 30:04.761
[woman] Listen to me.

30:05.261 --> 30:07.764
If you're gonna
go around attracting ghosts,

30:07.847 --> 30:09.641
don't blame it on my apartment.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.644
If you want to move out, fine, move out.

30:12.727 --> 30:15.897
But don't think for a second
that you're getting your deposit back.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.315
[disconnection tone beeps]

30:18.399 --> 30:19.359
-[groans]
-Hey!

30:21.778 --> 30:23.947
-Come on!
-Sorry.

30:26.741 --> 30:29.494
We got a big day of filming
and you're jabbering away?

30:31.162 --> 30:33.540
Okay. If you're ready, we'll begin.

30:34.249 --> 30:36.960
Uh, I've done some background research.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.671
I've seen some pictures of you
from high school.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.215
Hey, you were such a good-looking kid.

30:42.882 --> 30:44.551
The girls must have loved you.

30:45.176 --> 30:49.472
So, do you wanna tell us
what life in high school was like?

30:49.973 --> 30:54.686
Were there any big memories or incidents
you think you could share?

30:58.982 --> 31:00.024
Uh…

31:00.567 --> 31:01.734
What about friends?

31:01.818 --> 31:03.903
We all made friends back then.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.322
Friends who were important to us.

31:06.406 --> 31:08.908
Uh, did you have
any close friends you could…

31:12.829 --> 31:13.913
[Jen-yao] No.

31:13.997 --> 31:15.039
No friends.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.374
Really?

31:17.750 --> 31:18.585
Not Ouyang Ti?

31:20.044 --> 31:22.046
[tense music playing]

31:22.672 --> 31:24.048
Wasn't he your friend?

31:27.552 --> 31:28.428
[Ta-wei exhales]

31:31.681 --> 31:33.933
[exhales] Now let me see.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.145
Ouyang Ti.

31:38.646 --> 31:39.856
Chen Che-li.

31:41.441 --> 31:42.859
Chuang Jung-tai.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.944
Wang Yu-hsiang.

31:45.612 --> 31:46.654
Fan Wei-ting.

31:48.781 --> 31:50.033
Lin Meng-hung.

31:53.703 --> 31:56.289
Ah! Wasn't there another person?

31:56.873 --> 31:58.750
The pretty girl! [chuckles]

31:59.792 --> 32:00.668
Here.

32:01.961 --> 32:02.795
Chang En-ya.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.176
These here,

32:09.135 --> 32:10.303
they're the ones you murdered?

32:10.386 --> 32:11.220
[music fades]

32:11.304 --> 32:13.556
And you all happened to go
to the same high school.

32:13.640 --> 32:19.228
So when you say nothing happened,
you see, no one's buying that, you know.

32:19.312 --> 32:22.357
You could take this moment to explain

32:23.066 --> 32:24.943
what really occurred

32:26.069 --> 32:27.779
between you and these kids.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.910
[haunting music playing]

32:56.641 --> 32:57.976
[music fades]

32:58.059 --> 32:59.727
-Uh, Chou-yu?
-Hmm?

32:59.811 --> 33:01.396
[Ta-wei] You ask the next questions.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.439
-Me?
-[chuckles]

33:03.523 --> 33:05.400
Looks as if I've been talking to myself!

33:05.900 --> 33:07.068
Okay, come on.

33:07.568 --> 33:09.696
[clears throat] Go on then. You ask away.

33:09.779 --> 33:12.156
Go ahead when you're ready, okay?

33:13.408 --> 33:16.119
[Chou-yu] I'll pick up where we left off.

33:17.662 --> 33:18.788
Um,

33:19.497 --> 33:22.375
what happened in 2007?

33:23.167 --> 33:27.630
From what we know,
in 2007, you stabbed Ouyang Ti.

33:31.342 --> 33:33.011
Can you tell us about

33:33.594 --> 33:35.763
the nature of your conflict?

33:37.765 --> 33:39.767
[haunting music playing]

34:03.624 --> 34:07.045
What we want to know
is what led to these crimes.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.129
Not to litigate,

34:08.212 --> 34:11.591
but so the victims' families
can understand

34:12.091 --> 34:14.802
the reason that
they lost their loved ones.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.062
The rain.

34:31.861 --> 34:33.654
Because I hate the rain.

34:33.738 --> 34:35.031
[music fades]

34:39.827 --> 34:40.661
[Ta-wei grunts]

34:41.370 --> 34:43.081
Ta-wei, are you all right?

34:44.749 --> 34:46.084
This is your car.

34:46.584 --> 34:50.546
He hates the rain!
What kind of bullshit is that, huh?

34:51.047 --> 34:52.632
He hates the rain?

34:52.715 --> 34:54.509
That's not an excuse for murder.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.511
[Ta-wei sighs]

34:57.178 --> 34:58.221
You know what?

34:58.763 --> 35:00.765
I really wish that was a joke.

35:00.848 --> 35:02.809
So then we could just think
he was a bad liar.

35:04.143 --> 35:06.771
But that look he had on his face.

35:07.271 --> 35:08.689
He was deadly serious.

35:11.275 --> 35:14.487
Ta-wei, why did you
want to make this documentary?

35:22.578 --> 35:23.746
Why do you think?

35:24.872 --> 35:26.374
Why do I think?

35:26.874 --> 35:28.167
Um…

35:29.127 --> 35:30.378
Because…

35:32.046 --> 35:37.343
Because this case
got a lot of media coverage,

35:37.844 --> 35:40.888
so if you can discover his motive,

35:40.972 --> 35:43.558
which he never revealed to the media,

35:44.225 --> 35:47.311
then this documentary
will make you famous.

35:49.021 --> 35:49.981
[chuckles]

35:53.234 --> 35:54.277
That's for sure.

35:55.069 --> 35:56.195
You're so right.

35:56.279 --> 36:00.992
That makes more sense
than his excuse about the fucking rain.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.035
You're right.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.662
So Hsu Ta-wei,

36:05.163 --> 36:06.914
he's shooting a serial killer

36:07.915 --> 36:10.376
because he wants to be fucking famous.

36:19.093 --> 36:20.469
-Damn it.
-[engine revs]

36:20.553 --> 36:23.014
Speaking of rain, it's pouring down.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.974
What a pain in the ass.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.771
[thunder rumbles]

36:32.106 --> 36:34.525
[gentle music playing]

36:41.866 --> 36:44.619
USELESS, TRASH, IMBECILE, CURSED

36:58.674 --> 37:00.301

38:05.449 --> 38:07.785
-Hey, you're back.
-[man] Hey.

38:07.868 --> 38:09.161
The rain's so heavy.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.621
[man chuckles] It's fine.

38:10.705 --> 38:13.249
-Get changed and come and eat.
-[man] Okay.

38:18.879 --> 38:21.549
Hey. I thought you were gonna get changed.

38:21.632 --> 38:24.010
Ah, on my way back.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.053
I bought some cake for Wen-ling.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.723
Oh. Okay. Hurry up.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.487
[rain pattering]

38:50.578 --> 38:52.830
-[Chou-yu] Oh, Ta-wei!
-[Ta-wei] What?

38:53.372 --> 38:56.208
It's late. We should
get back to the office.

38:56.292 --> 38:57.418
Why are we here?

38:57.960 --> 38:59.962
You gotta make the most of God's gifts.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.213
What do you mean?

39:02.923 --> 39:06.802
Didn't our hero say
he kills people because he hates the rain?

39:07.511 --> 39:08.637
The Lord gave us rain.

39:09.305 --> 39:11.640
We can get some scenic footage, okay?

39:11.724 --> 39:14.977
And then, we can use it
as reaction shots in the documentary.

39:15.061 --> 39:18.356
It'll be great.
We'll never have money for a rain machine.

39:18.439 --> 39:21.067
We capture it now, or we never will.

39:32.912 --> 39:37.458

39:50.679 --> 39:56.143
[eerie distant screaming]

39:58.938 --> 40:01.649
[woman 1] Let's promise
we'll come back here together.

40:02.149 --> 40:05.653
[Jen-yao] All right. We'll come back.
The three of us will come here together.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.279
[woman 1] We'll get here earlier.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.117
[eerie whooshing]

40:18.541 --> 40:20.626
[man] Smile. Smile.

40:21.836 --> 40:27.133
[woman 2] Smile. Smile. Smile. [laughs]

40:27.216 --> 40:29.218
[haunting music playing]

40:42.731 --> 40:43.816
[Ta-wei] Chou Pin-yu.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.610
I'm getting wet here.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.535
There's a girl over there.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.459
[Ta-wei] A girl? Where?

[sobs]

41:40.080 --> 41:41.874
Get away! Get away!

41:41.957 --> 41:45.169
Why have you come here?
It wasn't my fault!

41:45.252 --> 41:46.754
-Leave me alone!
-[music fades]

41:46.837 --> 41:48.464
It wasn't my fault.

41:48.547 --> 41:50.758
[panting] I'm sorry.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.927
[screams]

41:53.719 --> 41:54.678
Get away!

41:55.179 --> 41:56.597
Get away!

41:57.097 --> 41:59.725
Get away! [sobbing]

41:59.808 --> 42:02.686
Get away! Get away!

[news anchor] Before the eggs
had even hit the shelves,

42:16.325 --> 42:20.246
lines of over 20 people
were forming outside PX Mart.

42:20.329 --> 42:23.791
Demand for the imported eggs
has been overwhelming.

42:25.709 --> 42:26.919
[woman] Hsiao-tung?

42:28.003 --> 42:29.213
Hsiao-tung?

42:29.755 --> 42:30.798
We're back.

42:34.927 --> 42:37.429
Hsiao-tung, have you eaten yet?

42:38.681 --> 42:40.307
If not, I'll cook something.

There's a girl over there.

[Ta-wei] A girl?

Hey, Shen.

Listen.

Tonight, I saw that same girl again.
