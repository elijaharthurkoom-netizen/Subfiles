2014

00:15.015 --> 00:16.433
Here's the money.

00:16.516 --> 00:17.684
Thank you.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.562
Have you had dinner yet?

00:23.690 --> 00:25.233
Then you have to eat more.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.152
Don't be a picky eater.

00:27.819 --> 00:30.363
BEEF NOODLE SOUP AND ASSORTED SIDE DISHES

00:31.823 --> 00:34.367
Menu is on the table. Sit.
Order anything you want.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.328
I have a customer. Gotta go.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.916
Sorry for the wait. Ready to order?

00:44.961 --> 00:46.504
One large beef noodle soup.

00:47.255 --> 00:53.261
LIN'S EATERY

01:03.229 --> 01:05.440
CLAIR DE LUNE

01:50.026 --> 01:51.861
This is a 50-year-old noodle shop.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.280
After last night's rain,
with puddles still around,

01:54.364 --> 01:58.409
the police cordoned off the area
because of a murder.

01:58.493 --> 02:02.413
The second-generation owner
was brutally killed.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.500
The police are investigating
any financial motives behind the case.

02:05.583 --> 02:09.045
The young owner was reportedly orphaned
and raised by his grandmother.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.714
He later took over her shop
and began supporting her.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.260
Neighbors say he was a filial child
who was polite and liked by many.

02:15.343 --> 02:16.886
But sadly, this happened.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.805
The old lady also lost her grandson.

02:18.888 --> 02:22.142
Influencer Chang En-ya, or Lisa,
went missing two weeks ago.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.519
The police had looked for
security footage for days

02:24.602 --> 02:28.148
but found that some cameras were damaged,

02:28.231 --> 02:29.649
indicating a well-planned act.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.694
The victim, Ti,
was former councilor Ouyang Hsiang's son.

02:32.777 --> 02:33.903
According to sources,

02:33.987 --> 02:36.573
the police have learned
the suspect's identity.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.160
The suspect had a dispute with Ouyang Ti
at school seven years ago

02:40.243 --> 02:41.911
and stabbed Ouyang with a knife.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.330
We'll continue to follow this story
and keep you updated.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.917
There was a chilling murder
in central Taiwan this afternoon.

02:48.001 --> 02:52.380
A 25-year-old man, Chuang, was dismembered
and dumped in a plastic barrel.

02:52.463 --> 02:55.425
When opened, a decaying,
dismembered body was found.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.509
Terrified, they promptly…

02:56.593 --> 03:00.096
This family murder
can almost be described as a bloodbath.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.848
The suspect's methods are cruel.

03:01.931 --> 03:04.017
He continued to bludgeon Wang
even after he died,

03:04.100 --> 03:05.226
and a young child was…

03:05.310 --> 03:08.438
Serial murders in the past few months
have caused widespread fear.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.064
The murderer has finally been caught.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.902
Li Jen-yao, dubbed "The Rainstorm Killer"
by the media, is only 25 years old.

03:13.985 --> 03:17.405
He turned himself in to the police
after killing his father yesterday

03:17.488 --> 03:20.283
and confessed to multiple murders.

04:45.451 --> 04:51.666
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

05:20.737 --> 05:21.738
Don't.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.905
Let me go. I beg you.

05:38.171 --> 05:42.258
2023

05:52.101 --> 05:54.937
It's because I read all these
before falling asleep.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.734
That's why I dreamed of
being hunted down by myself.

06:17.251 --> 06:19.796
Can I call in sick for having a nightmare?

06:50.410 --> 06:51.619
Did you go buy groceries too?

06:51.702 --> 06:53.704
Yeah. Hey, those scallions are expensive.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.331
Yes, outrageously expensive.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.332
Look, I didn't…

06:56.999 --> 06:58.000
I think it's her.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.460
I'll go ask.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.212
Hello, miss.

07:01.295 --> 07:04.132
Did you move in on the 18th floor?

07:04.215 --> 07:06.801
Yes, I just moved in last week.

07:07.301 --> 07:08.845
Sorry I haven't said hi.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.430
It's okay.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.224
Did you buy the place or rent it?

07:13.307 --> 07:14.725
Is there anything wrong?

07:14.809 --> 07:16.519
After moving in,

07:16.602 --> 07:21.315
have you heard heels clacking at night

07:21.399 --> 07:24.569
or your doorbell ringing continuously?

07:25.611 --> 07:26.446
No.

07:26.529 --> 07:30.283
You should've asked us longtime residents
first before moving in

07:30.366 --> 07:32.034
to see if this was a haunted place.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.661
You wouldn't have been fooled.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.204
-What?
-That's right.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.914
You say my place is haunted?

07:37.665 --> 07:40.668
But… the natural lighting is great inside.

07:40.751 --> 07:44.255
A very beautiful young lady
used to live in your apartment.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.757
She was killed on the mountain.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.552
Killed on the mountain?

07:51.220 --> 07:53.014
But she didn't die in her place.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.183
I don't think it's haunted.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.935
It's haunted if there are ghosts.

07:58.019 --> 08:01.189
Back then,
the alley was filled with reporters.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.982
WE FILM PRODUCTIONS

08:03.065 --> 08:05.568
STIGMATIZED PROPERTY SEARCH

08:09.071 --> 08:11.324
Why redact the addresses?

08:11.407 --> 08:13.159
How would I know which number it is?

08:14.744 --> 08:16.787
Is my place really haunted?

08:20.416 --> 08:21.667
Why are you so jumpy?

08:21.751 --> 08:23.503
Afraid I'd catch you slacking?

08:23.586 --> 08:24.795
No.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.422
I was looking something up.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.091
Come here.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.635
I want to talk to you.

08:33.387 --> 08:35.389
Hsu Ta-wei will be locked up
for three more days.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.183
How is your death row case going?

08:37.850 --> 08:39.268
If there's no progress,

08:39.352 --> 08:42.563
I want you to help me with some prep work.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.941
I got a commercial project, so I need…

08:45.733 --> 08:46.859
What's with that look?

08:47.735 --> 08:48.736
Out with it.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.243
Well, before Ta-wei began isolating,

08:55.326 --> 08:57.662
he asked me to focus on his case.

08:57.745 --> 09:01.165
He specifically told me…
not to let you steal me away.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.087
You're clearly
an assistant we hired together.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.297
How come you're
his personal assistant now?

09:11.175 --> 09:13.553
Has Li Jen-yao agreed to meet?

09:13.636 --> 09:15.388
He kept refusing before, didn't he?

09:16.639 --> 09:18.140
Ta-wei was persistent.

09:18.224 --> 09:21.227
So he asked me
to write a letter to Li Jen-yao.

09:21.310 --> 09:25.439
Ta-wei said I should give it
a more feminine touch.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.692
As if that would work.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.612
But the prison said
Li Jen-yao agreed to meet with me.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.114
What?

09:37.118 --> 09:37.952
Ta-wei.

09:38.035 --> 09:42.290
Listen, come out in 15 minutes.
Bring your equipment. I'll pick you up.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.042
It's only been two days.

09:45.126 --> 09:48.421
You can stop isolating now?
Or did you test negative?

09:49.171 --> 09:51.591
It's just a minor cold. Don't be silly.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.259
What's there to isolate?

09:54.510 --> 09:56.178
Anyway, come out in 15 minutes.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.431
Come on, Ta-wei.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.474
It might not be as strict now,

10:00.558 --> 10:02.977
but we should still follow the rules.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.896
Who's gonna know if we don't say anything?

10:06.939 --> 10:09.984
Hsu Ta-wei, are you tired of living?

10:10.526 --> 10:12.111
Do you have a death wish?

10:12.653 --> 10:14.363
Fine. I'll fulfill your wish.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.157
I'll be your assistant today.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.243
I'll wait for you by the door.
Come get me if you dare.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.166
Well…

10:26.542 --> 10:27.543
Yu.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.338
You heard what I just said, right?

10:30.421 --> 10:31.589
You go alone this time.

10:31.672 --> 10:34.634
Explain the process to them clearly.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.219
Well… I believe in you. You can do it.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.137
Good luck.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.458
Miss.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.502
Is something wrong?

11:11.212 --> 11:12.088
No, I'm fine.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.104
1027, someone's here for you.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.564
LI JEN-YAO

12:55.733 --> 12:56.901
Well,

12:56.984 --> 12:59.653
I'm an employee of We Film Studio.

13:00.821 --> 13:04.033
Our director is Hsu Ta-wei,

13:04.617 --> 13:05.451
and--

13:19.799 --> 13:20.716
Hello.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.721
Well, I'm an employee of We Film Studio.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.433
Hsu Ta-wei is the director.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.185
I'm the planner.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.187
My name is Chou Pin-yu.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.855
You can call me Yu.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.441
As in a fish.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.987
But officially,
it's like the one in Zhou Yu.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.200
Today, I…

13:46.283 --> 13:48.786
I want to discuss with you--

13:50.871 --> 13:53.541
Don't be nervous. I won't hurt you.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.334
Relax.

13:59.880 --> 14:00.923
Sorry.

14:02.591 --> 14:05.302
I don't usually get nervous so easily.

14:05.928 --> 14:09.265
I don't know why,
but seeing you gives me a strange feeling.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.226
Like something oddly familiar.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.104
But we just met.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.439
What am I talking about?

14:18.899 --> 14:20.025
The point is,

14:20.109 --> 14:22.319
as mentioned in my letter to you,

14:22.820 --> 14:25.781
my company wants to make
a documentary about you.

14:26.615 --> 14:30.119
It may involve details of the crimes.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.371
Why me?

14:37.293 --> 14:40.546
Director Hsu is the one who chose you.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.507
So I don't know why.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.969
But I guess it's because

14:47.052 --> 14:51.682
the director feels your cases
and story would interest the audience.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.936
Anyway, I hope you'll join our production.

15:01.483 --> 15:04.278
Is this job important to you?

15:14.788 --> 15:15.706
Okay.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.542
I agree.

15:20.502 --> 15:21.712
You agree?

15:23.213 --> 15:24.590
You really do?

15:27.217 --> 15:31.931
But I won't answer
questions I don't want to.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.767
Of course. We'll fully respect that.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.773
Let me briefly explain the process, then.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.319
There are three main stages.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.656
Preproduction, production,

15:48.739 --> 15:50.115
and postproduction.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.493
You'll just need to know
the production stage

15:52.576 --> 15:55.412
because that's when we'll shoot.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.582
And… the main part
is your self-introduction.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.167
We'll give you some questions

16:00.250 --> 16:04.088
and talk about
what you'll need to answer later.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.390
I think it's about time.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.642
That's all for today.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.186
Thank you.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.109
Will you…

16:28.153 --> 16:29.697
come again?

16:32.741 --> 16:34.284
I'll be there next time.

16:40.749 --> 16:41.959
Li Jen-yao.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.761
Why did you agree to this interview?

16:53.303 --> 16:54.680
Didn't you say no before?

16:57.641 --> 16:58.517
Disconnected.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.519
Did you hear me?

17:35.637 --> 17:39.516
Maybe it's because it's my first time
seeing a death row prisoner up close.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.896
I feel something

17:44.688 --> 17:46.315
I can't quite put my finger on.

17:46.398 --> 17:47.816
A death row prisoner?

17:48.317 --> 17:49.193
Who?

17:49.276 --> 17:51.570
It's that Li Jen-yao.

17:51.653 --> 17:54.531
He killed a lot of people a few years ago,
including his father.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.658
Remember the news about that?

17:59.703 --> 18:00.913
Of course I do.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.998
He committed so many crimes.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.000
It was big news. How could I forget?

18:08.587 --> 18:11.965
Even though he's in jail now,
he's a dangerous person.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.676
It's probably best to stay away from him.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.554
At first, I thought he'd be scary too.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.807
That I'd be too scared to speak.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.393
But

18:24.937 --> 18:26.688
I met him today.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.525
He doesn't seem

18:30.526 --> 18:32.569
as bad as the media claims.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.786
When I first saw him,

18:41.703 --> 18:44.081
he didn't look like a murderer to me.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.046
You think he's cute?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.840
No, I don't.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.259
Then why do you keep defending him?

18:56.009 --> 18:57.511
Stop talking nonsense.

18:57.594 --> 18:58.804
Fine.

19:00.722 --> 19:01.807
Are you all moved in?

19:02.516 --> 19:03.934
Do you need any help?

19:05.435 --> 19:08.272
I told you I'd help you find a new place,

19:08.355 --> 19:09.815
but you wouldn't let me.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.276
Great. Now you've got a haunted place.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.029
Hey, no.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.614
I told you over and over.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.658
You are my cousin, not my mom.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.202
You don't have to do everything for me.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.456
Auntie doesn't come close
to your micromanaging.

19:27.124 --> 19:30.294
Also, getting this haunted place
was just an accident.

19:31.461 --> 19:34.381
Accident? I think
you just wanted the cheapest deal.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.300
You're renting for less than 10,000 here.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.594
Didn't you find it weird?

19:39.219 --> 19:41.638
I didn't give it much thought back then.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.935
Based on what your neighbors said,

19:47.019 --> 19:48.312
she didn't die there.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.189
So the place isn't haunted.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.481
What are you afraid of?

19:53.233 --> 19:55.903
-What if she misses home?
-What?

19:56.403 --> 19:59.615
I'm afraid she'd suddenly miss home
and come back.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.325
What would I do then?

20:03.076 --> 20:04.912
I saved this fruit especially for you.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.830
Take them to school. Eat them, okay?

20:06.914 --> 20:08.540
No need, ma'am. No, thanks.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.043
Excuse us.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.795
Do you sell here too?

20:16.215 --> 20:19.134
Oh yeah, we're selling here these days.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.221
Come to our fruit stall if you have time.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.765
These are really sweet.
I handpicked all of them.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.016
Take them.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.100
That's enough.

20:28.101 --> 20:31.313
Sorry, my wife just feels
a connection with you.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.564
She means no harm.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.607
I'm sorry.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.567
Let's go.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.110
Don't be late for school.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.244
Let's go.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.372
Sis, do you remember them?

20:48.455 --> 20:52.167
I met them right outside your place
and Ta-wei's studio before.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.293
Now,

20:54.336 --> 20:56.922
they seem to know wherever I go.

20:58.340 --> 21:02.511
And the wife seems to mistake me
for someone else every time.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.304
It's weird.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.307
Aren't you overthinking?

21:07.391 --> 21:10.978
It's normal for fruit sellers
to go around Taipei with their stalls.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.688
It's probably just a coincidence.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.107
Let's go.

21:35.335 --> 21:37.337
How did you find this place?

21:38.088 --> 21:41.883
How many times are you gonna ask?
I told you I found it on the Internet.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.971
Miss Chou,
a deliveryman dropped this off for you.

21:46.054 --> 21:47.931
I didn't order anything.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.359
Who sent it?

21:59.943 --> 22:01.445
It's Chi-chi.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.530
She knows I moved,
so she's giving me this.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.673
Don't scare me.

22:22.257 --> 22:23.467
What did you see?

22:25.093 --> 22:26.720
Is there really a ghost?

22:27.596 --> 22:30.057
Even a ghost would leave
if it saw this mess.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.019
How long have you been living here?

22:34.561 --> 22:36.229
Why are your things still in boxes?

22:36.730 --> 22:38.398
And what's up with these socks?

22:42.069 --> 22:44.905
Is the laundry on the bed clean or dirty?

22:45.447 --> 22:46.323
Where do you sleep?

22:48.075 --> 22:50.118
Just… over there.

22:51.828 --> 22:52.662
No way.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.833
I don't think you're fit to live alone.
You'd better move back in with me.

22:59.252 --> 23:02.005
We'll talk about that later. Take a seat.

23:03.006 --> 23:03.882
Here.

23:03.965 --> 23:05.467
I'm giving Chi-chi a call.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.226
Hello, Chi-chi.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.144
I received your gift.

23:16.728 --> 23:17.604
Thank you.

23:17.687 --> 23:20.440
Hey, how could you not invite me
when you were moving?

23:21.191 --> 23:22.275
How's it going?

23:22.359 --> 23:23.318
Not bad.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.237
Things are going well.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.864
As if! You sound weird.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.534
Hey, I'm your gal pal.

23:30.617 --> 23:34.329
How could you keep secrets from me?
You should tell me everything.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.082
Are you gonna tell me or not?
Are you? Are you?!

23:37.165 --> 23:39.668
Come on! Or I'm coming straight over!

23:39.751 --> 23:40.919
It's really nothing.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.337
Don't worry.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.047
We'll chat over dinner sometime.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.048
Jeez…

23:45.132 --> 23:46.716
Okay, talk later. Bye.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.305
Hey, don't tidy up.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.015
I'll do it myself.

23:54.683 --> 23:57.894
You're making it seem like
I only asked you here to clean.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.563
I'd feel bad.

24:00.522 --> 24:01.356
It's fine.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.734
I used to do your laundry anyway.

24:04.818 --> 24:07.154
Okay, just take a seat.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.382
Did I put my phone in this bag?

24:31.136 --> 24:32.179
Ta-wei.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.016
Okay, one second.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.100
Go ahead.

24:38.935 --> 24:40.687
Interview with Li Jen-yao next week.

24:41.438 --> 24:44.274
Okay, I'll call you
when I finish organizing the info.

24:44.357 --> 24:45.984
Okay, bye.

25:08.465 --> 25:11.218
FIRST MEETING WITH LI JEN-YAO

25:39.454 --> 25:40.914
Is it raining?

27:35.403 --> 27:37.155
Hsiao-tung, are you there?

27:37.906 --> 27:39.866
Can you hear me?

27:41.451 --> 27:42.869
You hear my voice?

27:44.829 --> 27:47.207
Can you please wake up?

27:52.253 --> 27:53.254
What's wrong?

27:55.048 --> 27:56.716
Why did you wake up suddenly?

27:57.634 --> 27:59.135
I'm fine.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.769
Wake up.

28:09.062 --> 28:11.064
Why did I have such a weird dream?

28:27.831 --> 28:28.915
Pin-yu.

28:29.624 --> 28:30.583
Are you okay?

28:33.211 --> 28:34.796
I'm fine.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.423
I'm just using the bathroom.

28:57.777 --> 28:59.904
-Sis!
-What's wrong?

29:01.030 --> 29:04.367
I just saw another girl in the mirror.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.080
Are you too tired
to recognize yourself in the mirror?

29:09.164 --> 29:10.832
Why would I not recognize myself?

29:10.915 --> 29:13.042
Go and take a look. It's scary.

29:49.954 --> 29:52.499
Ma'am, please calm down.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.083
What do you want?

29:54.834 --> 29:56.961
I didn't say I'd move out.

29:57.045 --> 30:00.882
I just want to know
what happened in this place.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.343
Why else would rent be so cheap?

30:04.052 --> 30:05.261
Let me tell you,

30:05.345 --> 30:07.722
don't put the blame on my property

30:07.806 --> 30:10.308
when you're the one
who catches something dirty outside.

30:10.391 --> 30:12.685
If you wanna move out, fine.
It's up to you.

30:12.769 --> 30:15.897
But don't expect me
to return your deposit.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.445
Hurry up!

30:23.112 --> 30:24.197
Sorry.

30:26.699 --> 30:29.494
First day and you're already moving slowly
and chatting on your phone?

30:31.120 --> 30:33.540
Okay. We're ready. Let's get started.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.960
I did some research beforehand.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.796
I saw your photos from high school.

30:40.463 --> 30:42.215
Honestly, you were quite handsome.

30:42.298 --> 30:45.051
I bet a lot of girls liked you.

30:45.134 --> 30:46.010
Well,

30:46.094 --> 30:49.347
could you tell us about
your time in high school?

30:49.430 --> 30:54.686
Anything profound or unforgettable
that you can share with us?

31:00.525 --> 31:01.734
What about friends?

31:01.818 --> 31:05.738
You know, we make friends as students.

31:06.364 --> 31:07.782
Did you have any good friends…

31:12.829 --> 31:14.998
No. I had no friends.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.499
Really?

31:17.792 --> 31:19.168
What about Ouyang Ti?

31:22.672 --> 31:23.965
He wasn't your friend?

31:32.181 --> 31:33.349
Let me see.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.186
Ouyang Ti.

31:38.688 --> 31:39.981
Chen Che-li.

31:41.441 --> 31:42.692
Chuang Jung-tai.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.944
Wang Yu-hsiang.

31:45.612 --> 31:46.654
Fan Wei-ting.

31:48.781 --> 31:50.033
Lin Meng-hung.

31:54.913 --> 31:58.082
There was also a pretty girl.
What was her name?

31:59.542 --> 32:00.668
This one.

32:01.961 --> 32:03.212
Chang En-ya.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.176
All of them

32:09.093 --> 32:10.303
were killed by you.

32:11.137 --> 32:13.556
How come they all went
to the same school as you?

32:13.640 --> 32:17.018
If you said
nothing happened in high school,

32:17.101 --> 32:18.394
no one would believe it.

32:18.478 --> 32:22.231
Why not take this opportunity to tell us

32:22.899 --> 32:27.779
what exactly happened
between you and these people in the past?

32:58.309 --> 32:59.310
Yu.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.396
You take over.

33:01.980 --> 33:05.817
-Me?
-Was I talking to a wall?

33:05.900 --> 33:07.026
Come on.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.696
You ask the questions. You can do it.

33:09.779 --> 33:12.156
Go ahead when you're ready, okay?

33:13.408 --> 33:16.160
I will continue
with the director's questions, then.

33:19.497 --> 33:22.417
What happened in 2007?

33:23.167 --> 33:27.630
Based on the information available,
you stabbed Ouyang Ti in 2007.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.927
Can you tell us

33:33.594 --> 33:35.763
if there was any conflict between you?

34:03.624 --> 34:06.252
We want to know
why you committed these crimes,

34:07.003 --> 34:08.129
not from a legal perspective,

34:08.212 --> 34:11.466
but because the victims' families
deserve to know

34:12.050 --> 34:14.886
what they lost their loved ones for.

34:22.935 --> 34:24.062
Rainy days.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.571
Because I hate rainy days.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.081
Ta-wei, are you okay?

34:44.749 --> 34:46.084
This is your car.

34:46.584 --> 34:50.463
He hates rainy days.
What bullshit reason is that?

34:51.047 --> 34:52.632
He hates rainy days,

34:52.715 --> 34:54.509
so he killed ten people?

34:57.095 --> 34:58.596
Honestly,

34:58.679 --> 35:02.809
I'd rather he'd tried to fool us
with some random excuse, you know?

35:03.893 --> 35:06.395
But you saw his expression just now.

35:07.396 --> 35:08.689
He was serious.

35:11.234 --> 35:14.487
Ta-wei, why do you want to make
this documentary?

35:22.578 --> 35:23.579
What do you think?

35:24.956 --> 35:26.582
What do I think?

35:29.127 --> 35:30.503
It's because…

35:32.004 --> 35:37.051
because he's currently considered
the most infamous serial killer.

35:37.844 --> 35:40.930
So if you can get him
to talk about his motive

35:41.013 --> 35:43.558
for the first time on camera,

35:44.267 --> 35:47.311
maybe the documentary
will make you a famous director overnight.

35:53.317 --> 35:54.277
You're right.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.195
It makes sense.

35:56.279 --> 36:00.408
At least it's more logical
than fucking rainy days.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.035
Right.

36:03.119 --> 36:07.498
I, Hsu Ta-wei, am willing
to film this serial killer

36:07.999 --> 36:09.959
because I want to be fucking famous.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.388
Look at that! It's raining.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.057
Annoying.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.619
USELESS, TRASH, IMBECILE, CURSED

38:06.284 --> 38:07.618
-You are back.
-Hey.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.120
It's pouring with rain outside.

38:09.203 --> 38:10.454
It's all right.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.415
Go get changed and come eat.

38:12.498 --> 38:13.332
Okay.

38:19.505 --> 38:21.841
Aren't you gonna change?
Where are you heading?

38:22.758 --> 38:26.053
I bought Wen-ling's favorite cake
on my way back.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.848
Okay, hurry up, then.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.705
-Ta-wei.
-What?

38:53.372 --> 38:54.206
It's so late.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.834
What are we here for? Why not the office?

38:57.835 --> 38:59.962
This is our chance. How can we let it go?

39:00.046 --> 39:01.547
What do you mean?

39:02.923 --> 39:05.051
Didn't our male lead say today
that he killed people

39:05.134 --> 39:06.802
because he hates rainy days?

39:07.428 --> 39:08.637
It's raining now.

39:09.263 --> 39:11.390
We can get some aerial footage

39:11.474 --> 39:15.978
to use as background in the documentary.
Isn't that great?

39:16.479 --> 39:18.356
If we don't shoot it now, when will we?

39:18.439 --> 39:21.067
When we get a rain truck?
Do we have the money for that?

39:58.854 --> 39:59.814
It's a deal, then.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.108
The three of us will come here again.

40:02.191 --> 40:05.653
Sure, the three of us
will come here again.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.196
We'll come earlier next time.

40:42.690 --> 40:43.816
Chou Pin-yu.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.610
Carry the umbrella for me.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.535
There's a girl in the rain over there.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.417
A girl? Where?

41:40.372 --> 41:41.874
Don't come any closer.

41:41.957 --> 41:43.167
What do you want?

41:43.751 --> 41:45.169
It wasn't my fault.

41:45.252 --> 41:46.754
Don't come any closer.

41:46.837 --> 41:48.589
It wasn't my fault.

41:53.802 --> 41:56.514
Don't come any closer!

41:58.015 --> 42:03.562
Don't come any closer!

42:13.364 --> 42:16.242
The eggs weren't out yet,
and over 20 people were already waiting.

42:16.325 --> 42:18.869
The supermarket started selling
imported eggs today, too,

42:18.953 --> 42:20.246
washed and graded in the US.

42:20.329 --> 42:23.165
But within ten minutes, they were already…

42:25.751 --> 42:28.587
Hsiao-tung. .

42:29.630 --> 42:31.090
I'm back.

42:34.927 --> 42:36.011
Hsiao-tung.

42:36.095 --> 42:37.846
Have you had dinner yet?

42:38.639 --> 42:40.474
If not, I'll cook for you.

43:52.838 --> 43:53.881
Chou Pin-yu.

43:54.381 --> 43:55.758
Carry the umbrella for me.

43:56.967 --> 43:59.470
There's a girl in the rain over there.

43:59.553 --> 44:00.387
A girl?

44:01.263 --> 44:02.264
Where?

44:21.033 --> 44:22.076
Hey, sis.

44:22.576 --> 44:23.577
Listen.

44:24.328 --> 44:27.790
I think I saw that girl again tonight.
